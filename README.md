# ðŸš€ Customer Behavior Analysis with PySpark ðŸš€

This project performs large-scale analysis of e-commerce customer data to uncover purchasing patterns, segment customers, and identify behavioral trends using Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities via PySpark. The entire pipelineâ€”from data generation to machine learning and insight reportingâ€”is executed in a distributed manner, making it suitable for big data workloads.

## ðŸ“Š Project Pipeline

1. **Data Generation**  
   A scalable function generates a large synthetic dataset of customers and transactions directly within the Spark cluster, avoiding memory bottlenecks on the driver node.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Raw transaction data is enriched to create key metrics like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, along with customer lifetime metrics.

3. **Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**  
   Customers are segmented into distinct groups like "Champions," "Loyal Customers," and "At Risk" based on their RFM scores.

4. **Machine Learning Clustering**  
   K-Means clustering is applied to group customers into distinct personas based on demographic and behavioral features.

5. **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**  
   The analysis explores purchasing patterns related to the day of the week, product categories, and payment methods.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**  
   The final step summarizes key business metrics and provides actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
